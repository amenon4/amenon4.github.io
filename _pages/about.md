Welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate in the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of Rochester. I'm advised by Professor Thomas Howard. My work is centered on solving problems pertaining to terrain-aware navigation and mobile robot path planning in unstructured environments. I have worked on various research programs in the field of off-road autonomy, most notably DARPA RACER, ARL SARA, and ARL DCIST.

Currently, my work proposes novel methods of wheeled robot motion planning using temporal and spatial sampling in order to encourage safe navigation in cluttered, partially observable environments.

I earned my B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Rochester in 2020 as well as my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from U of R in 2024.
