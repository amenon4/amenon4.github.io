Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of Rochester. I'm advised by Professor Thomas Howard. My work currently revolves around solving problems pertaining to terrain-aware navigation and mobile robot path planning in unstructured environments. I have worked on various research programs in the field of off-road autonomy, most notably the DARPA RACER, ARL SARA, and ARL DCIST programs.

Currently, my work leverages homotopy constraints in order to encourage safe robot navigation in cluttered environments.

I earned my B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Rochester in 2020 as well as my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from U of R in 2024.
